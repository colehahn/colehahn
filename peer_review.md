### Developer guidelines
-  [x] There are developer guidelines, which I could easily find in the repository.

-  [x] The developer guidelines are self-contained and well structured.

-  [x] The description of the repository structure is clear and makes sense to me.
  -  It's a little weird how there are two nested src directories

-  [x] The instructions for how to add a new test case are clear and make sense to me.
  -  Please specify where tests should go

-  [ ] I could build the software, following the provided instructions, on a machine matching the prerequisites mentioned in the instructions.
  -  I was unable to run `npm start` on attu! I have no idea why, but it should be simple to recreate. I left a comment on [this issue](https://github.com/abbybatinga/librocast/issues/24#issuecomment-1136533929)

-  [x] I could test the software, following the provided instructions.

-  [x] The continuous integration (CI) setup makes sense to me, and I could find the build history.
  -  CI details not in developer guidelines (we didn't have them there for our project either) (not sure if they are supposed to be).
  -  I looked at your .yml file and it seems reasonable to me, running tests when code is pushed
  -  I see that your builds are consistently failing on github! :( Maybe it would be best to remove tests that fail until the behaviour is implemented, so that way you can get :heavy_check_mark: instead of :x:

### User manual
-  [x] There is a user manual, which I could easily find in the repository.

-  [x] The high-level description of the system is clear.

-  [ ] The user manual is self-contained, well structured, and comprehensive.
  -  Yes, just needs to be filled out with more info as you implement more features

-  [x] The user manual contains all instructions required to use the system.

-  [ ] I could install/run the software, following the provided instructions.
  -  Landing page link just goes back to documentation, presumably because web server is not yet running. fair enough

-  [ ] I could use the software, executing the functionality described in the manual.
  -  N/A, as I was not able to run the software with npm start
  

-  [x] The instructions for filing a bug report are clear and sufficient.

### Feedback

Hi team Librocast, I really like what you have for your web app so far! I wasn't able to run it, but I watched someone else use it, and I am very impressed with the layout/aesthetics of the site. It looks professional and well-made. I see that you are still missing a fair bit of functionality, so be sure to be making lots of progress in this last week.

One thing I noticed is that I felt a little overwhelmed by the file structure. I suppose this is normal when jumping into a project of this size, but I think I would have benefited from a more detailed description of your files. Specifically I think you should mention the files that are needed/generated by npm, where they are and what they do, and maybe some more details about your build system in general, because I had a tough time using npm.

I really look forward to seeing the final result!
